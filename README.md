# The Linux Command Line

These are my notes from working through the book
[*The Linux Command Line*](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php)
by [William Shotts](http://linuxcommand.org/index.php)
and published on January 2012.

## Synopsis
Designed for the new command line user, this 537-page volume covers the same material as LinuxCommand.org but in much greater detail. In addition to the basics of command line use and shell scripting, The Linux Command Line includes chapters on many common programs used on the command line, as well as more advanced topics.
